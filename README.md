# Blog App with React & Firebase

[See the page](https://fire-blog-app-milestone-react.vercel.app/)

* I made a Blog App with React & Firebase(for Database and Authentication).
* Users can add, delete and edit blog posts.
* There are some restrictions. Only the author of the post can edit or delete the post.
* Everybody can see the details if they are already registered.
* Adding image url is not required. If user leave it blank then a random image appears.
* I used Material UI for styling.
* I used Firebase Realtime Database for storage.
